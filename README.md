### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Ikraam](ikraamghoor.com). I am a **full-stack developer** and freelancer.

I've worn many hats in my career in the spaces of education and technology. Although I am a proud jack of all trades, my experiences have led me to dive into software development, where I believe I can make the most impact.

Coming from an electronic engineering degree, I have been fortunate to have an all-rounded technological prowess and a knack for applying technology effectively in real-world scenarios. This ability was one of the most highlighted skills coming from my senior peers. The second of which was the ability to work productively with anyone in a team.

My current software forte is **Ruby on Rails** , which is soon to be coupled with JavaScript and React

If you believe I will be a **great fit for your team** (and project), please reach out , and I will get back to you in a flash!
